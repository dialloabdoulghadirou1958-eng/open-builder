## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 24 LTS (recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for version management)
- pnpm 11
- Git

### Local Development

```bash
# 1. Fork and clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/open-builder.git
cd open-builder

# 2. Install dependencies
pnpm install

# 3. Start the development server
pnpm dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:5173` and enter your API Key in settings to start debugging.

### Available Commands

```bash
pnpm dev      # Start dev server (hot reload)
pnpm build    # Build for production
pnpm preview  # Preview production build
pnpm lint     # TypeScript type checking
pnpm test     # Unit tests
pnpm test:ui  # UI smoke tests
```

## Project Structure

Before contributing, familiarize yourself with the core modules:

```
src/
├── lib/generator.ts      # Core engine: WebAppGenerator (Tool Call loop)
├── lib/tavily.ts         # Web search tool
├── lib/settings.ts       # Settings persistence
├── store/conversation.ts # Zustand session state management
├── hooks/useGenerator.ts # Hook connecting engine to UI
└── components/           # UI components
```

**Exercise caution** when modifying the core engine (`generator.ts`) — it directly affects AI tool call stability.

## Pull Request Process

1. **Create a branch**

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/issue-123
   ```

2. **Develop and commit**

   Keep each commit focused on a single change and follow the commit convention.

3. **Ensure code quality**

   ```bash
   pnpm lint   # Ensure no TypeScript errors
   pnpm build  # Ensure build succeeds
   ```

4. **Push and create PR**

   ```bash
   git push origin feat/your-feature-name
   ```

   Create a Pull Request on GitHub with:
   - A brief description of the changes
   - Related Issue (if any)
   - Testing method

5. **Wait for review**

   Maintainers will review your PR as soon as possible. Please be patient and address feedback accordingly.

### PR Guidelines

- Keep PRs focused — one PR per concern
- Ensure your PR is based on the latest `main` branch (rebase if there are conflicts)
- Do not include unrelated formatting changes in the PR

---

## Code Style

- Use TypeScript; avoid `any` (add a comment explaining the reason if necessary)
- Use functional components with React Hooks
- File naming: PascalCase for components, camelCase for utility functions
- Keep code concise and avoid over-abstraction
- When adding new tools, define them in the `BUILTIN_TOOLS` array in `generator.ts` and add handling logic in the `executeTool` switch
